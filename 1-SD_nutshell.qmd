::: {.panel-tabset}

### Ideation

:::: {.columns }

::: {.column #vcenter width="80%"}

::: {.subhead}
What are we going to do?
:::

- Brainstorming
- Research

:::

::: {.column width="20%"}

### Requirements

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="80%"}

::: {.subhead}
How are we going to do it?
:::

Some topics to help define requirements include:

- final goal
- project scope (how to reach the final goal)
- what is feasible (and how)
- what is priority
- what resources are available
- deadlines
- potential risks

:::

::::

::: {.warning}
Warning: Each person involved in the project may have a different need.
:::

### Design

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="80%"}

::: {.subhead}
What is the software architecture?
:::

When designing software, the object-oriented approach is a common programming paradigm.

Object-oriented components:

- Classes: A user-defined type
- Object instances: A particular object instantiated from a class.
- Methods: A function which is “built in” to a class
- Constructor: A special method called when instantiating a new object

Some principles: abstraction, encapsulation, decomposition, generalisation

### Development

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="80%"}

::: {.subhead}
Is this where the fun begins?
:::

# Take your time!

Development is usually the most time consuming step in a Software Development Life Cycle.

:::

::: {.column width="20%"}

:::

::::

### Test

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="80%"}

::: {.subhead}
Is this software good?
:::

In this step, errors and failures are identified by exposing the code to an environment similar to the end-user experience.

:::

::: {.column width="20%"}
![](assets/img/sd-nutshell/test.png)
:::

::::

There are several types of testing, some examples include:

- **Unit testing:** are all components working?
- **Integration testing:** are all components working when fitted together?
- **Performance testing:** how does the software perform against different workloads? It is fast? Stable?
- **Functional testing:** is the software aligned with Software Requirement Specification?

### Deployment

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="80%"}

::: {.subhead}
Can other people use my code?
:::

You can use platforms like [GitHub](https://github.com/) to release your software.

:::

::: {.column width="20%"}
![](assets/img/sd-nutshell/deployment.png)
:::

::::

- The **functionality** of the software is linked to **several specifications** related to the operating system and versions of packages and other software related to the project.
- **Listing these specifications will help** others to replicate the environment in which the software was developed.

### Maintenance

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="80%"}

::: {.subhead}
Is it over?
:::

You can use platforms like [GitHub](https://github.com/) to release your software.

:::

::: {.column width="20%"}
![](assets/img/sd-nutshell/maintenance.png)
:::

::::

We can classify maintenance into a few categories:

- **Corrective:** fix reported errors/failures.
- **Preventive:** regular checks and fixes.
- **Perfective:** optimize implemented features, adding new features.
- **Adaptive:** keep the software updated according to changes external to the project (new programming language version, new regulation, etc.).
